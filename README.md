# sqlalchemy-challenge
In the challenge we were asked to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, we used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
To create multiple queries of data and later use Flask to convert the API data into a valid JSON response object.
Instructions

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.
Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. To do so, complete the following steps:
Note that you’ll use the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.
Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database.
Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.
Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
